Functions
---------

pack
^^^^
.. function:: pack(format[, *values, **kwargs])

   Packs the values and keyword arguments according to the *format* string and returns a new :class:`BitStream`.
   
   :param format: string with comma separated tokens
   :param values: extra values used to construct the :class:`BitStream`
   :param kwargs: a dictionary of token replacements
   :rtype: BitStream

The format string consists of comma separated tokens of the form ``name:length=value``. See the entry for :meth:`~ConstBitStream.read` for more details.

The tokens can be 'literals', like ``0xef``, ``0b110``, ``uint:8=55``, etc. which just represent a set sequence of bits.

They can also have the value missing, in which case the values contained in ``*values`` will be used. ::

 >>> a = pack('bin:3, hex:4', '001', 'f')
 >>> b = pack('uint:10', 33)

A dictionary or keyword arguments can also be provided. These will replace items in the format string. ::

 >>> c = pack('int:a=b', a=10, b=20)
 >>> d = pack('int:8=a, bin=b, int:4=a', a=7, b='0b110')
 
Plain names can also be used as follows::

 >>> e = pack('a, b, b, a', a='0b11', b='0o2')
 
Tokens starting with an endianness identifier (``<``, ``>`` or ``@``) implies a struct-like compact format string (see :ref:`compact_format`). For example this packs three little-endian 16-bit integers::

 >>> f = pack('<3h', 12, 3, 108)

And of course you can combine the different methods in a single pack.

A :exc:`ValueError` will be raised if the ``*values`` are not all used up by the format string, and if a value provided doesn't match the length specified by a token.

Module Options
--------------

bitstring.lsb0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default bit numbering in the bitstring module is done from 'left' to 'right'. That is, from bit ``0`` at the start of the data to bit ``n - 1`` at the end. This allows bitstrings to be treated like an ordinary Python container that is only allowed to contain single bits.

When bitstrings are interpreted as integers and other types the left-most bit is considered as the most significant bit (MSB).

This feature allows bitstring to use Least Significant Bit Zero
(LSB0) bit numbering; that is the final bit in the bitstring will
be bit 0, and the first bit will be bit (n-1), rather than the
other way around. LSB0 is a more natural numbering
system in many fields, but is the opposite to Most Significant Bit
Zero (MSB0) numbering which is the natural option when thinking of
bitstrings as standard Python containers.

To switch from the default MSB0, use the module level attribute ``bitstring.lsb0``. This defaults to ``False`` and unless explicitly stated all examples related to the bitstring module use the default MSB0 indexing.

    >>> bitstring.lsb0 = True

Slicing is still done with the start bit smaller than the end bit.
For example:

    >>> s = Bits('0b000000111')
    >>> s[0:5]
    Bits('0b00111')
    >>> s[0]
    True

Negative indices work as you'd expect, with the first stored
bit being `s[-1]` and the final stored bit being `s[-n]`.


bitstring.bytealigned
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A number of methods take a bytealigned parameter to indicate that they should only work on byte boundaries (e.g. find, replace, split). Previously this parameter defaulted to ``False``. Instead it now defaults to ``bitstring.bytealigned``, which itself defaults to ``False``, but can be changed to modify the default behaviour of the methods. For example::

    >>> a = BitArray('0x00 ff 0f ff')
    >>> a.find('0x0f')
    (4,)    # found first not on a byte boundary
    >>> a.find('0x0f', bytealigned=True)
    (16,)   # forced looking only on byte boundaries
    >>> bitstring.bytealigned = True  # Change default behaviour
    >>> a.find('0x0f')
    (16,)
    >>> a.find('0x0f', bytealigned=False)
    (4,)

If youâ€™re only working with bytes then this can help avoid some errors and save some typing.

Command Line Usage
------------------

The bitstring module can be called from the command line to perform simple operations. For example::

    $ python -m bitstring int:16=-400
    0xfe70

    $ python -m bitstring float:32=0.2 bin
    00111110010011001100110011001101

    $ python -m bitstring 0xff "3*0b01,0b11" uint
    65367

    $ python -m bitstring hex=01, uint:12=352.hex
    01160

Command-line parameters are concatenated and a bitstring created from them. If the final parameter is either an interpretation string or ends with a ``.`` followed by an interpretation string then that interpretation of the bitstring will be used when printing it. If no interpretation is given then the bitstring is just printed.


Exceptions
----------

.. exception:: Error(Exception)

    Base class for all module exceptions.

.. exception:: InterpretError(Error, ValueError)

    Inappropriate interpretation of binary data. For example using the 'bytes' property on a bitstring that isn't a whole number of bytes long.

.. exception:: ByteAlignError(Error)

    Whole-byte position or length needed.

.. exception:: CreationError(Error, ValueError)

    Inappropriate argument during bitstring creation.

.. exception:: ReadError(Error, IndexError)

    Reading or peeking past the end of a bitstring.
